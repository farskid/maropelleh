## TODO

- [ ] Make snakes more wiggly
- [ ] Refactor moves to account for animations and delays
  - [ ] Suspense in dice rolling
  - [ ] Suspense in moving
  - [ ] If the move includes clibming a ladder or sliding down a snake, the move is a sequene of moves so each get their own transition on the board
- [ ] Refactor board data structure for better lookup performance
